# pph-prototype
prototype
We are an incubator organization focused on integrating mature cloud services and building modular, scalable platform architectures. We have a technical review team responsible for evaluating architectural quality, security, maintainability, and future scalability.

This project is based on integrating mature third-party APIs, SaaS, PaaS, and other cloud components, instead of building each module from scratch.

After the prototype is completed, we will evaluate it based on architectural clarity, logical rigor, maintainability, and future scalability. If the evaluation is successful, you will be added to our long-term cooperation partner list.

In addition, this project will have five supporting professional platform websites, and these five platforms will also adopt a cloud assembly model and be developed sequentially. If the cooperation goes smoothly, these projects will also be assigned to you.

Due to business confidentiality and external competition, I cannot provide our real names, company name, or phone number, and we will not conduct voice or video communication. All communication will be done through email. Thank you for your understanding.

please carefully read the prototype requirements below. The purpose of this prototype is to confirm architectural direction, cloud component compatibility, and future scalability. This is not a one-time demonstration. The structure should be clean, extendable, and reusable for later development stages.

1.The prototype needs to include:

（1）User registration and login:
- A scalable login and authentication structure
- An email verification flow
- A simple user profile page layout

（2）Payment placeholder:
- Reserve a location for integrating Stripe or PayPal
- Display a payment button
- After clicking, go to a “Pending Integration” page

（3）AI customer support placeholder:
- Provide an entry button on the interface
- Reserve a display area for a future AI chat window

（4）Cross-language text translation (must work):
- The user inputs text and receives a translation result
- You may use any free open API (for example, LibreTranslate)
- The left side shows the input，and the right side shows the translated result
- Voice translation is temporarily not required

（5）Analytics dashboard layout:
- A placeholder chart for user growth trends
- A placeholder chart for activity metrics
- A placeholder chart for order data
- Only the layout is required; no real data is needed

（6）Visual frontend:
- A global navigation bar
- Multiple pages that can be navigated normally
- Backend-only work is not accepted

（7）Backend structure:
- Simple routing design
- Clear folder organization
- Reserve several empty API endpoints for future use

（8）Cloud object storage placeholder (S3 compatible):
- An upload button
- When clicked, display a placeholder message

（9）Idempotency placeholder:
- Reserve an idempotency key field in the API design (a comment is acceptable)

（10）Architecture explanation page:
- One simple English page describing the structure and future expansion directions

2.Delivery requirements:
- Provide a publicly accessible URL that can be opened directly in a browser
- Do not require passwords, verification codes, invitations, IP whitelists, or any manual approval
- Do not require us to log in to view the prototype
- ZIP delivery alone is not accepted
- Screenshot-only or document-only submissions are not accepted
- Video demonstrations are not accepted
- The translation feature must be functional

3.Source code:
- Provide a public repository link (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket are all acceptable)
- It must open directly without a password
- We must be able to browse the code structure online without downloading

4.Accessibility requirements:
- We must be able to open the demo website directly without contacting you
- We must be able to open the repository directly for review

5.Important note:
If critical parts are missing, inaccessible, or cannot be verified, we will not continue cooperation. Completing the prototype does not guarantee selection. The purpose is to avoid wasted time and duplicated effort in later development.

6.Recommended delivery time: Within 7 days.

Thank you.

Additional note regarding the technology stack:

To ensure long-term maintainability, scalability, and alignment with our engineering guidelines, this prototype must be built using a modern and reusable web stack based on:

Frontend:
- React or Next.js (recommended)

Backend:
- Node.js with Express or Nest.js

Database (placeholder allowed):
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL

Cloud storage:
- S3 compatible service

Please do not use outdated or monolithic stacks such as PHP/Laravel or legacy JSP.

This prototype must follow modern architectural patterns and be suitable for future modular expansion.
